# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Capstone Project - Multi-channel Convolutional Neural Network for Text Classification

### This repository contains project work for for Udacity's [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) from February 2018 cohort.

The model is greatly inspired by Yoon Kim's work, which he published in his paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882).

For the text/ word visualization, we relied heavily on the code from [Nick Brooks](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/guided-numeric-and-text-exploration-e-commerce), who is one of the top contributors of the Kaggle data set - [Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).

### Note on the Python scripts in the repository:
* stats.py: Include helper functions for performing statistical inference and visualizations
* nlp.py: Include helper functions for preprocessing text
* cnn.py: Include helper functions for building CNNs
